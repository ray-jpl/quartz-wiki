{"/":{"title":"Raymond's Wiki","content":"\nHi, I'm Raymond! I'm a computer science student at UNSW.\n\nThis is my personal notes/wiki website. Learning new things is something that I love doing but keeping track of the notes I write during learning is difficult. Often times I would have information split between Google Drive and OneNote but these platforms feel somewhat inflexible at connecting ideas smoothly. I discovered [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) for taking notes that seemed to be an effective approach to build a comprehensive knowledge database.\n\nThis wiki will contain notes on Computer Science/Software Engineering concepts and anything else I think may be relevant or interesting. These are my [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) so I hope to be constantly growing this database over time. \n\nIf youre interested in learning more about Obsidian or how I set this website up just visit [[notes/Obsidian Notes]].\n\n\nTo navigate between topics just click on the links below or just any node on the graph.\n\n## Contents\n- [[notes/Obsidian Notes]]\n\n## Algorithms\n- [[notes/Topological Sort]]","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T10:12:24.818312996Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Obsidian-Notes":{"title":"Obsidian Notes","content":"\n## Setup\nTo setup Obsidian Notes just install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and you can immediately start taking notes. There are many different ways to setup your Obsidian editor and many plugins to use in order to customise your experience. I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/E6ySG7xYgjY) first to get an idea but there are tonnes of YouTube tutorials out there.\n\nIf you wanted to deploy your notes as a website, you don't have to pay for the [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service but it may be easier if you have less technical knowledge. Otherwise I used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) hosted using Github Pages which is very beginner friendly with comprehensive instructions but also highly customisable if you want to put in the effort. However there are other plugins available on the internet that seem to be popular as well. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T10:12:24.818312996Z","tags":["Obsidian","Quartz"]},"/notes/Topological-Sort":{"title":"Topological Sort","content":"date: 2023-03-21\ntime: 20:59\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-21T10:12:24.818312996Z","tags":[""]}}
