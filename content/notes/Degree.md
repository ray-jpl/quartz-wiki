## Degree
The **degree** of a node is the number of edges connected to the node.

The **maximum degree** of a graph is the highest degree of all nodes.

### Directed Graphs
For directed graphs, node can have an **indegree** and an **outdegree** which corresponds to the number of incoming and outgoing edges respectively.

### Indegree 
- The number of incoming edges
