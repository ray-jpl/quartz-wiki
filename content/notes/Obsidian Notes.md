## Setup
To setup Obsidian Notes just install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and you can immediately start taking notes. There are many different ways to setup your Obsidian editor and many plugins to use in order to customise your experience. I recommend watching [this video](https://youtu.be/E6ySG7xYgjY) first to get an idea but there are tonnes of YouTube tutorials out there.

If you wanted to deploy your notes as a website, you don't have to pay for the [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service but it may be easier if you have less technical knowledge. Otherwise I used [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) hosted using Github Pages which is very beginner friendly with comprehensive instructions but also highly customisable if you want to put in the effort. However there are other plugins available on the internet that seem to be popular as well.
