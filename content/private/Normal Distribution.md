## Normal Distribution
>[!note] Definition
>A normal distribution is a **continuous** probability distribution that is used to model things that are distributed relatively symmetrically, on a bell curve.
>$$f(x;\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$$
>where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma^2$ is the variance
