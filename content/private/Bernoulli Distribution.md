## Bernoulli Distribution
>[!note] Definition
>A bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is used for a single trial in which there are only binary outcomes. We use the formula $$f (x; p) = p^x (1 − p)^{1−x}$$ where $p$ is the probability and $x$ is 0 or 1 depending on whether the event of interest occured or not.
>
>Try substituting $x = 0$ and then $x = 1$. In one case, the function will equal $p$, in the other case $1 − p$. This is what we expect because there are two events that can occur.
>The probability mass function is:
>$$\begin{equation}
p(x)=
\begin{cases}
1-\pi, & \text{if}\ a=0 \\
\pi, & \text{if}\ a=1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}\\
\end{cases}\end{equation}$$
