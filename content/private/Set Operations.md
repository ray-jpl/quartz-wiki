## Complement
The complement of Set A is denoted by $A^c$ and is the set of points that do not belong to A

## Union
The union $A\cup B$ of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of points that belong to at least one of them.
Described as "A or B".

## Intersection
The intersection $A \cap B$ of $A$ and $B$ is the set of points that belong to both sets.
Described as "A and B".

## Commutative Law
$$A\cup B=B\cup A$$
$$A\cap B=B\cap A$$
## Associative Law 
$$(A\cup B) \cup C = A\cup(B\cup C))$$
$$(A\cap B) \cap C = A\cap(B\cap C))$$
**Note**
Brackets are needed to indicate the order of operations that are to be performed. 
For the associative law we can write them as 
$$A\cup B \cup C$$
or
$$A\cap B \cap C$$

however something like $A\cup B \cap C$ is ambiguous and undefined as $(A\cup B) \cap C \neq A\cup (B \cap C)$.

## Distributive Law
$$(A \cup B) \cap C = (A \cap C) \cup (B \cap C)$$

$$(A \cap B) \cup C = (A \cup C) \cap (B \cup C)$$

## De Morgan's Laws
$$(A \cap B)^c = A^c \cup B^c$$
$$(A \cup B)^c = A^c \cap B^c$$
